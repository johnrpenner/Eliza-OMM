OMM is an objectiveC port of the original ELIZA basic programme in 1973 ðŸ–¼ 
the interface uses an iconic image of christ by hans memling â€” which is a 
scifi THX-1138 reference â€” what's wrong? ðŸ‘¾ speak your truth. 

OMM is a really stupid AI compared to todays highly-statistically trained 
neural nets â€” using semantic conjugation tricks, and randomization of 
subject keywords, and working as a Rogerian psychotherapist to prod a user 
into revealing more information and talking about themselves â€” leading them 
to think they've had a 'conversation'. simple semantic bag of tricks.
